### Problem Statement
Harry is a well-known property dealer from San Francisco, California whose objective is to buy and sell properties. Now, he wants to buy properties in Oakland. As he has very less idea about the properties in that particular city, he needs a proper understanding of the properties and factors related to it. 

Because of it, he is taking an online survey from citizens who want to sell their property, through an app. 

By doing the survey he'll get data related to the property sale price and various factors related to it. Later, he figured out a way to extract data from the app, but, here is when the problem started.

The data that he extracted are in JSON format which he doesn't have any idea about. And the data is of no use until he gets insight from it.

He says he has lost millions of dollars buying inappropriate properties. That is why this time he wants to rely on data to take the right decision.

So, he wants me to take those data and convert them into a set of visualization answering some questions so that he can have a clear picture of the properties and decide whether to invest his time, effort and money into Oakland's properties.

Since the online survey will run for the next 7 days, he wants to have a solution that will automatically update the visualization whenever he collects the data.

After 7 days of the survey, he will take the decision whether to proceed forward and contact the property owners on the basis of insights.

 He gave me a set of questions that he needs answers to. The questions are :

1. What is the number of properties built each year?
2. What are the different types of Paved driveways? Show the percentage.
3. What is the average sale price of properties on the basis of different lot shapes?
4. What is the average sale price of properties built each year?
5. What is the minimum sale price of the property?
6. What is the average sale price of the property?
7. What is the maximum sale price of the property?

11. What is the average sale price of the properties on the basis of the type of street and basement condition?
12. What is the average sale price of the properties on the basis of the year built and garage condition?
13. What is the maximum sale price of the properties on the basis of the year built?
14. What is the minimum sale price of the properties on the basis of the year built?
15. What is the average sale price of the properties on the basis of the number of fireplaces?
16. What is the average sale price of the properties on the basis of the type of kitchen quality?
